<p><strong>Introduction to Debugging in JavaScript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In this course, I focused on debugging techniques for JavaScript to identify and resolve issues within code. Debugging is crucial for ensuring that programs run smoothly and produce the expected results. The course covered various types of errors and introduced tools and methods to efficiently troubleshoot and fix code problems.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>JavaScript Console:</strong> A tool for logging information and errors, essential for debugging JavaScript code in browsers.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Platforms with built-in developer tools to aid in debugging.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Understanding Errors:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Syntax Errors:</strong> Identified and corrected mistakes that prevent code from running, such as missing brackets or incorrect keywords.</li>
      <li><strong>Runtime Errors:</strong> Diagnosed issues that cause unexpected behavior during execution, such as undefined variables or function calls.</li>
      <li><strong>Logical Errors:</strong> Traced and fixed mistakes where the code executes without crashing but doesnâ€™t produce the desired outcome.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Debugging Tools and Techniques:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Console Logging:</strong> Used <code>console.log()</code> to output values and trace execution flow to understand and diagnose problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Breakpoints:</strong> Set breakpoints in the JavaScript debugger to pause execution and inspect variables and code behavior step by step.</li>
      <li><strong>Error Messages:</strong> Interpreted and addressed error messages to pinpoint and resolve issues efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Preventive Practices:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Code Reviews:</strong> Emphasized the importance of reviewing code to catch potential issues early.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Implemented tests to check for common pitfalls and ensure code functionality.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
